She was pretty pissed since she was an extremely fit, 20-something, blond, athletic Christian female.  It wasn't the suggestions that were the problem for her, just the fact that the site hid profiles from her that it didn't deem to be a good fit.On a side note, is EHarmony still around?

I started out with Match.com on a whim, but found that the model just wasn't right for me; launching a barrage of e-mails to folks who seem like they might match based off a picture and a few words never seemed promising and though I did typically get replies, most did not meet my idea of a match.Incidentally, Match.com recommended that I try their sister service, Chemistry.com, which proved significantly more effective for me. Chemistry works similarly to EHarmony, in that you're presented with a small set of possible matches each day and then for those you may be interested in, you're guided through a series of hoops eventually leading up to exchanging e-mail. While the idea of pre-screening might seem as though it'd lower your chances of finding someone, I found that it only meant the quality of people matching you was much higher; you only actually wound up spending time talking to people who had made it past the quirks from the prior phases.For what it's worth, I've been happily in a relationship with someone I met off Chemistry about four months ago."

I happen to know 3 married couples who met on dating sites, two of those were on eHarmony. And believe me or not, one is the leader of a WoW guild who found a REALLY hot wife on it...The thing that dating sites fail to capture adequately (for me) is the initial ""wow!"" chemistry... or lack thereof. Pictures are quite the liars! A woman who looks ""meh"" in photos ends up being hot because of how she moves (or some other non-static parameter), another woman who looks smoking in a photo only does so because it was washed out./met his gf through a mutual acquaintance, still probably the best way"

It skips over that part where you get to know each other because you already read the profile and know everything already.

This introduction was only after a lot of questioning about why I wasn't allowed to pick up the doll and why it always stayed in bed with her.Turns out, when she was young she had first started experimenting with her own body using Lawrence's foot and now, to this day, she could only get-off by using Lawrence's foot as a sex toy.Once it was determined that I thought this wastotally awesomethe three of us had some great times together.  Man, she would go nuts for Lawrence. Huge, long, full-body, quivering, screaming orgasms. You can guess whose name she was yelling out.It's hard for me to believe that this diet coke story actually happened. Then again, it's hard for me to believe that I would ever stand in awe and emasculated by the sexual prowess of a Cabbage Patch Kid."

I'd been with plenty of girls of all types at that point. Girls from many demographics and backgrounds, ones with all kinds of fetishes, fantasies and hangups. I'm kind of a weird guy and I seem to attract a weird caliber of women. I'd worked in a dungeon at this point too and some other aspects of the adult entertainment industry so very little surprised me at this point.The foot. Yeah. Not exactly symmetrical. Imagine a shoe horn trying to extract something that's not there.Anyways, it wasn't that she wanted to play with the doll that shocked me at all, or even that sheneededit in order to really get-off. It was her seeming level of emotional attachment to the thing that got me. I know that people are supposed to (and women more so than men) kind of emotionally imprint upon things when they climax. However most sex toys don't necessarily have human faces and names (there are some obvious exceptions) nor are they objects from childhood. I can relate to starting masturbating at a very early age, much as she apparently did, however, she was doing it with something that was a friend and companion. If you can remember, toys really did have a life of their own back then, and even if you knew it wasn't true, part of you really did love them and really did see them as alive.So the emotional aspect of it was the most curious and exciting part of it all. I'm not just hamming up a cool story when I say she would yell the dolls name in the throws of orgasmic pleasure and she was very protective of it even if it wasn't ""intimate time"".This woman was a completely functional, cool, smart, fun, productive, together young adult. And that's what I meant about people just being nutty and fascinating when it comes to sex and why (even though it sure sounds made up) the koolaide man story could just as easily be real. People are weird and when they let themselves be weird it is sexy and awesome."

My first sexual ezxperience that actually involved nudity. While we're fondling each other, she asks me if I like Diet Coke.Me: It's allright 
Girl: Well I LOVE it. How 'bout you go get me a bottle of it?I go downstairs and grab a 20 ounce bottle from the fridge. When I return she says it's too cold.Girl: How 'bout warming it up...by rubbing it on my tits?So I bega to rub her vigorously with the bottle. Soon enough, she asks me to shove it inside her. She really enjoys it, and so do I because I KNOW that with this girl, I'm definantly going to get off. That's when it gets crazy.She rips out the bottle, opens it, and begins filling her vagina with Diet Coke. I swear, she nearly empties the volume into her vagina. I had seriously underestimated this vagina's liquid retention volume.Girl: YOU LIKE DIET COKE?!?!?!? OH YEAH OH YEAH DRINK IT FROM ME!I was noticebloy freaked me, but I did want to get off, and I didn't want my first load-blow to be into 18.7 fluid ounces of a 0-calorie beverage. I began to go down on her, until she said the exact wrong thing.Girl: OH YEAH, DRINK IT FROM ME! I'M THE KOOL-AID MAN! OH YEAH! OH YEAH!I don't know how she did it with 16-year-old voice, but she sounded exactly like the Kool-Aid man from the commercials. I glanced at the wall, half-expecting him to burst through and over me a fruity beverage. I was extremely turned off. she could tell, too. As she sat up to see what was wrong, she twisted her body in such a way that Diet Coke shot out of her vagina and all over my face, chest, and groin. It was at that sticky, low-calorie moment that my parents chose to pull into the driveway. The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought, ""Nah, forget it. Yo, holmes to Bel-Air!"" I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and I yelled to the cabbie, ""Yo holmes smell ya later!"" Looked at my kingdom I was finally there, to sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air."

I just bought a 2009 Focus and I love it, and it got 35+ MPG on the trip from DC to Pittsburgh to visit family for Thanksgiving.The 2010 Focus should be even nicer, since I hear they're just bringing the European model to the US.  (My 2009 has a lot of European-styled features, and despite being quite compact, it sits high enough to not end up wedged under someone's Escalade.)Ford will be able to take a loan and improve their bottom line.  Chrysler, I don't even know about, but I'm pretty sure they don't make money on anything anymore.  GM will have to cut a lot of fat to get back in the black, but if they drop/combine brands, they've got attractive enough offerings to survive."

Of course the big three make them, Chevy Aveo, Ford Focus, anyone? And of course Toyota and Honda etc. make giant honking land whales. I think Toyota Tacomas and Land Cruisers probably use more gas in a month than my car uses in a year. The big three were better at making trucks and SUVs, and they knew they couldn't beat Toyota at their own game, so that's where they put their money. Comparative advantage, economics 101. That's what's been keeping them afloat for the last decade or so, so I won't knock them for doing it. I'm certain that even with all these restrictions on what they can make, they will still go broke."

GM and Chrysler don't have the cash and can't get low-interest loans to fix themselves, so they basically keep fucking themselves up.Think of it this way - it's like sending someone to school at a low interest rate so they can come out of school with a better education and get a better job (and they will pay you back with interest)."

Toyota, Honda and Nissan has all sold HUGE SUV's and trucks in North America and made HUGE profits on all of that sheet metal.(Have you seen the size of a Nissan Armada?! I was astounded). Japanese auto makers make large profits in the US, not in their home country.As for quality, the domestic stuff is WAY better than it used to be.

And all those businesses who depend on selling to my employees will be out of work too; it'll be horrible!  By my wholly unsubstantiated estimation, 10 million people will be out of work and the USA will fall into a depression if I don't get a huge, uncollateralized loan that amounts to free money with no penalty to me if I don't pay it back (but I promise I will!)So sign right here, I mean, how could you not?!

They actually sell more vehicles than GM, so it stands to reason that they would bemorehurt by the downturn, and yet that's not the case.As for why they're failing, I once had a management class that looked at the inevitable demise of Ford.  Aside from the fact that Ford spent years ignoring what American consumers wanted in a car, the company has an unbelievably fucked up hierarchy.  From the lowest salesperson up to the president of the company, there are35levels of management.  Pair that with the fact that many people are overpaid at nearly every level.  You can't build a company with that much bloat and expect it to survive.  It's designed to collapse.Explain how allowing a million auto-related workers to become unemployed is beneficial.It certainly doesn't benefit anyone to add a million people to the jobless list, but I just don't understand how that enters into this discussion.  At the end of the day, this is about business.  It's not the taxpayers' responsibility to guarantee that you work for a company that can sustain itself.  It's also not the taxpayers job to save your company because it's going to collapse and leave you unemployed.  While it often gets crapped on, we have a very good unemployment system in this country, and this is why it exists.Explain why banks only lend money to successful companies and never to new start-ups or companies that need financial assistance.Banks generally don't fund startups, that's what venture capital firms are for.  VC firms also have very strict standards and models that they follow to make sure they get a solid return on their investment."

This is also why Chrysler is asking for funds despite being owned by a company that could easily afford to issue them a loan (if they wanted to throw their money away, that is).So instead, they're going to the government and instructing the representatives to fund the loan by forcibly confiscating money from taxpayers, since nobody will voluntarily assume the risk. THAT is what's rubbing a lot of people the wrong way; simply asking for a loan is not the issue here."

I used to work on them and have a good insight on what really makes them tick.They have an internal accounting system as well to try to keep things on track, so it's not completely random. It knows what the next spin is going to output before you even put in your cash or hit a button. They also have the ability to deny you a jackpot and spit out something else if it disagrees with their accounting rules. You'll just never know that this ever happened."

I spent more than 20 years in the slot machine biz and was working for Bally when they introduced the S-5000 model in the early '90s, which pretty much copied IGT's S-Plus design.All solid-state gaming devices (slots, video poker, video...whatever) use a pseudo-random number generator [PRNG] on the motherboard -- acting in concert with the program chip set -- to determine the results of a play. However, this does NOT occur until the first coin dropsorthe first credit is played.In slots for instance, a series of numbers for each reel is constantly being generated by the PRNG. Although the reels haven't spun yet, it's true that the combination is pre-selected before the player sees the results. But hitting the SPIN button a few milliseconds earlier or later would result in a totally different outcome.For example, Bally's popular three-reel Blazing 7s game had 64 discrete positions on each reel. Only one position on each reel was the ""jackpot"" winner, which meant that your odds of winning the top prize were 1 in 262,144 (64x64x64) [Thanks for correcting my error, readers!]. The PRNG constantly streamed three sets of numbers (one set for each reel) from 0 to 63.The Telnaes Patent is generally regarded as the pioneering work that created the ""virtual reel."" This meant you were not physically restricted to the number of symbols that might fit on a reel strip (the piece of long, skinny plastic that contains the cherries, oranges, single- double- and triple bars, etc.). The old mechanical slots usually had 22 or 24 ""stops,"" which meant that the largest jackpot you could offer had odds of 1 in 13,824 (24 cubed). In order to offer larger prizes, engineers needed to find a way to increase the number of stops on each reel. The only other way do do this was by adding more reels. Back in the 1980s, right on the cusp of solid-state slots (Bally's E-2000 model, for instance), people would rarely play games with more than five reels, since the odds against them were so incredibly visible (24 to the fifth = 317,952 possible combinations). By ""virtually"" assigning a symbol to each three-number combination (on a 3-reel machine), you could technically get by with only one of each symbol on each reel. You can also hide the number of actual stops from the player. Bally's Naughty Nickels game had 128 stops on each of three reels, which gave the top award a 1-in-2,097,152 chance of occurring. Of course, it was originally a million nickels ($50,000), not bad for wagering only 15 cents per play.The programmer would assign a symbol to each ""virtual reel stop."" On reel one, let's say that the Blazing 7s game had blanks on all the odd numbers, single bars on 18, 26, 38, 44, 62, double bars on 2, 8, 14 -- well, you get the idea. Then assume each reel has its own set of numbers assigned to symbols. Remember, the symbols are only there to enlighten the player.  If the PRNG rang up #41 for Reel One, it would stop spinning at a blank. If it generated #14, the player would see it stop on a double-bar.I agree with some of the comments posted below that ""seeding"" the PRNG caused problems in the early days, especially for casinos that happened to switch on the machine at the same time every day. But programmers eventually created a number of sub-routines to change the way the initial combination was seeded, and we haven't seen a whole lot of slot cheating in the past dozen or so years."

Only ONE three-number combination yields a jackpot win. You can't look at the reels as individual winning opportunities, because the processor doesn't work that way. Each PRNG three-number string exists unto itself, yielding a specific (or no) payout. So in the aforementioned example, there are 262,144 combinations in a game's ""universe."" Only one will give you the top jackpot -- let's say, 2500 coins. Other three-number sets will pay out lesser amounts, or nothingIn fact, analyzing what's called the pay table is how manufacturers come up with the payback percentage for each particular program. Assume that a gambler hits every possible combination exactly once in 262,144 plays, with no repeats. That's called a ""game cycle."" Add up the number of coins wagered. In this case it's a three-coin game, so that means the gambler would put 786,432 coins into the machine. Then add up the number of coins that would have been returned (with zero for the combinations that yield no payout). Let's say the second number totals 723,520. Your game program would therefore be a 92.0% game -- a fairly typical payback for a 25-cent machine. Dollar machines will often run from 95% to 97.5%.Most machines will hold very close to their rated percentage over the course of 3-4 cycles. But because each spin is random, of course, it's entirely possible to hit the top award on the machine's very first play out of the box. This will heavily skew the ""hold"" percentage for quite a while, but the law of probability eventually catches up.In my earlier example of Bally's Naughty Nickels game, one casino here in Colorado saw a single machine pay out the top jackpot TWICE during its first two weeks on the gaming floor. But no one ever hit it again, and they retired the machine after about ten million spins."

They ultimately went out of business in the States.Universal Distributing of Nevada (the U.S. subsidiary of a Japanese company that built its fortune on manufacturing pachinko machines) sold some of the most popular slot machines in the late '80s and early '90s, especially in the Las Vegas market. Programmers had devised what came to be known as the ""near miss"" feature, which was originally approved by the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB).Here's how it worked. If the PRNG came up with a known non-winning (zero-payout) combination -- let's say a blank on Reel One, a blank on Reel Two, and three bars on Reel Three -- the program went through a separate loop and instead ""landed on"" a 7 on Reel One, a 7 on Reel Two, and a blank on Reel Three, oftentimes with that third 7 hanging one line above or below the center pay line. This caused the unsuspecting gambler to think, ""Gosh, if that third reel had only kicked up one more step, I would have won the jackpot.""Solely because of this feature, Universal's slots out-earned every other brand for several years running. Casinos were buying them hundreds at a time (at US$5000 a pop in 1990 dollars), much to the dismay of their two main competitors: Bally and IGT. The latter company, even today the first- or second-largest gambling machine manufacturer in the world -- they're usually neck-and-neck with Australia's Aristocrat (Pty) Ltd -- used its considerable political clout to make the NGCB take another look at the near-miss feature. The control board eventually ruled it illegal (claiming, if memory serves, that the extra loop removed the ""randomness"" of the event), forcing the company to retrofit every one of its thousands of machines with new program chips that lacked this feature.A terrific analysis of this story can be found in""License to Steal""by Jeff Burbank. The book also has a chapter on the American Coin Machine scam (they were one of my customers, although I didn't know what they were doing at the time), which involved the still-unsolved murder of an employee who was just about to go to the Feds regarding a programming ""flaw"" in the company's video poker machines that made it impossible to hit a royal flush."

Computers are predictable on a fundamental level, and the machines are designed to make you lose a certain percentage of your money on average.Whether it calculates cards and then hands, or hands and then cards, does not matter mathematically. They are different views of the same thing. There is no randomness in either case, and the demands are met in both: illusion of randomness and a certain pay-off.Since the machines are not random, people willalwayscomplain that the computer is cheating. If it choses cards, the random number generator used controls the pay-off in the same way. The pay-off is just a bit more obfuscated. It makes cheating harder to see, which may please the superficial crowd who thinks it's getting a fairer treatment. The casino will make sure it has the same profit either way though.The difference is the ease with which the profit can be checked and manipulated. That's where law enforcement comes in. The profit is more explicitly defined in this case. If it is illegal to delay jackpots, talk to your lawmakers. They will be delayed if the cards are chosen as well.

So they have no electoral component to their activism, and hence predictable get very little accomplished.Then we have that portion of the activist community and their supporters who are networked, are realistic, and are effective.

I don't know whether the check somehow got missed when it was processed, but fortunately I didn't need the money at that point so my checking account never went negative.One thing I have noticed a lot is that ATM machines have a lot more downtime than they I remembered in the past.  I have gone to an ATM machine 3-4 times in the last year that was apparently non-functional.

It then goes through the proof department as normal. The ATM simply puts a temporary credit to your account for the amount you typed in.

Before or after you replied (I forget the order) it had been downvoted. Since my comment is true, the only reason to downvote it is if you feel I'm bashing the government undeservedly, or if you just don't get it.I was pointing out that those you elect with your votes, theoretically control large amounts of tax money.This is true, but that means having a broken system would be to their advantage. If there were checks and balances corrupt politicians wouldn't be able to buy votes via these private companies. Generally speaking, the corrupt ones care the most about the money.Meanwhile, having a broken system for gambling would mean politicians get less money. If the system is broken then you lose the overt taxes, and with no rules there is no need to bribe government officials. With a tightly run ship however, the government will get most of the tax money and politicians are able to take bribes to loosen the rules. No rules no loosening required."

Which of course is only free for the first 1000 minutes.So for the national calling package you are still paying $50 before all the fees put on top of it. Which, btw, VoIP is more regulated than the normal phone companies. They even have regulation fees which are fees to pay the government to monitor their own company. Then they have the 911 fee. The local phone number fee. Then normal state and federal fees.After it is all said and done, you are still paying pretty much the same as with AT&T or any other phone company.The same can be said about Cox, or at least when I was with them a couple years ago."

Frankly, I never had the motivation to be an A student once natural ability lost ground to the necessity to study, the cost to benefit ratio never seemed to make sense for me.

One rock has a different weight (that means it can be lighter or heavier than the rest of the rocks). You have abalance. You can weight the rocks 3 times in any order you want but after the 3rd weighting you need to know exactly which rock is the different one and if it's lighter or heavier than the rest of them.

If they weigh the same, then the ""bad"" rock is among the remaining 4. In this case the problem isn't that hard (if you next weigh 2 of the remaining 4 against 1 of the remaining 4 + 1 of the original 8, you're practically done).If the first 8 rocks don't all weigh the same, it's trickier. Call the 4 rocks on the heavier side of the balance 'h' and the 4 on the lighter side 'L' and the 4 leftover rocks (that you know to be standard weight) 's'. Your next step should be to weigh 6 rocks, like so:hhL vs. hLsIf they weigh the same, these 3 h's and 2 L's clearly all weigh the same. So you have 2 L's and 1 h left over that could be the ""bad"" rock, so just weigh the 2 L's against each other and you're done.If the hhL side is heavier, weigh the 2 h's on that side of the scale against each other, and you're done.If the hLs side is heavier, weigh the h on that side against an s and you're done.I omitted why you're done to save space. I hate it when math textbooks do that, but this is reddit, so, to quote a cartoon character, I do what I want."

You don't know which of the L's is the abnormal one, so instead of weighing them against each other you would pick one and weigh it against an 's'.  If they weigh the same the other L is the abnormal one, and if they don't that L is the abnormal one (obviously).Edit:  just noticed you also said,weigh the 2 h's on that side of the scale against each other, and you're done.The final step in each case is to weigh one of the 2 suspects against an 's'.I imagine your brain snuck in the assumption that you know whether the abnormal stone is heavier or lighter, but you only know that it is heavier OR lighter."

When compressing, high frequency information is usually thrown away.  For this reason, the DCT is poor at capturing sharp changes.  GIF and PNG, on the other hand, are better for computer graphics and logos.  They use an indexed palette (encode fewer colors).  They perform poorly on natural images, which may produce a wide range of color values."

Photos and stuff don't tend to have as many sharp edges, so it's not as noticeable and tends to compress better.  But with things like text and logos, you get blurry edges and the compression isn't that great.GIF and PNG are both lossless, so better for things like text.  GIF is a very simple compression algorithm, whereas PNG is smarter, and so is more often used nowadays.FerricOxide, you obviously know more about this than I do, does that sound about right?"

Also, the main motivation for PNG was to avoid the patented LZW compression algorithm, since people had to pay royalties to use GIF in their hardware or software.  PNG has a lot more features than GIF, including the ability to store more than 256 colors, an alpha layer, and better compression (just to name a few).Also, an interesting factoid: ThePNG websiteuses aJPEG image for their logo."

Usually, the people I work with know what they are so we just throw these terms around, but I shouldn't do so when I'm explaining what it is.  Here are some explanations for people who don't know:DCT(Discrete Cosine Transform): a data transform similar to the Fourier Transform, but designed to generate real coefficients.  Its basis functions are formed from cosine waves at varying frequencies.KLT(Karhunen Loeve Transform): A transform based on the data that is optimal in the mean-square sense (mss).  It is often used to compare to a transform that is not data dependent.  Its basis functions are generated in order from highest energy to lowest energy (you can think of energy as how representative a certain function could be with respect to your data)."

Having twice, in my long-ago youth, chosen the fair and earnest young lady in lieu of the wild, wanton, and concupiscent, yet obviously unfaithful bawdy girl, I lived to regret my choice both times. After the ardor had cooled, the reserved and chaste girl always turned out to be a princess with a high self-regard, little interest in sex, and little skill therein, yet with an immense degree of entitlement and condescension.I should have made hay with the lustful and inconstant ones, and forsaken the careful, self-respecting girls, who are just duds anyway.Hell, your romances almost certainly won't last, so grab the one with the bedroom skills and keep your condom on tight. They're all interested in gaining social position -- and impressing their female friends -- by showing off the men they sleep with, but the sluts care less than most, which means your chances at sincere, honest interaction are paradoxically higher with the slut. And the chaste, modest girls are simply pretending to you, and perhaps to themselves, that they take their romances so much more seriously, and have much higher standards than that slut Allison who lives down the street.Sluts of my past, I salute you! Time for a slut appreciation day. Acknowledge the role that sluts play in society, and celebrate their ability to cut through the bullshit and enjoy themselves."

So the thing to do is start with the one who will least likely sleep with him if he gets with any of the others, and work through them as many at a time as he can, with the biggest slut at the end. That is his mission. Get busy."

Men are often tops or bottoms if gay, with matching personalities.Being gay is natural, but so are sexual roles.

it's simply in our dna."

There is no middle ground.People are all just that - people.

Bottoms tend to stay bottoms. Think about it yourself - do you change from being passive and dominant in all your relationships or do tend you stick to one role?Genetics is truth, and genes make people what they are.

In the most common type of flame, hydrocarbon flames, the most important factor determining color is oxygen supply and the extent of fuel-oxygen ""pre-mixture"", which determines the rate of combustion and thus the temperature and reaction paths, thereby producing different color hues. In a laboratory under normal gravity conditions and with a closed oxygen valve, a Bunsen burner burns with yellow flame (also called a safety flame) at around 1,000 °C. This is due to incandescence of very fine soot particles that are produced in the flame. With increasing oxygen supply, less blackbody-radiating soot is produced due to a more complete combustion and the reaction creates enough energy to excite and ionize gas molecules in the flame, leading to a blue appearance. The spectrum of a premixed (complete combustion) butane flame on the right shows that the blue color arises specifically due to emission of excited molecular radicals in the flame, which emit most of their light well below ~565 nanometers in the blue and green regions of the visible spectrum.Flame temperatures of common items include a blow torch at 1,300 °C, a candle at 1,400 °C [1], or a much hotter oxyacetylene combustion at 3,000 °C. Cyanogen produces an even hotter flame with a temperature of over 4525 °C (8180 °F) when it burns in oxygen.[5]Generally speaking, the coolest part of a diffusion (incomplete combustion) flame will be red, transitioning to orange, yellow, and white the temperature increases as evidenced by changes in the blackbody radiation spectrum. For a given flame's region, the closer to white on this scale, the hotter that section of the flame is. The transitions are often apparent in TV pictures of fires, in which the color emitted closest to the fuel is white, with an orange section above it, and reddish flames the highest of all. Beyond the red the temperature is too low to sustain combustion, and black soot escapes. A blue-colored flame only emerges when the amount of soot decreases and the blue emissions from excited molecular radicals become dominant, though the blue can often be seen near the base of candles where airborne soot is less concentrated.[edit] Flames in microgravity
In zero gravity, convection does not carry the hot combustion products away from the fuel source, resulting in a spherical flame front.In the year 2000 the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States discovered that gravity also plays an indirect role in flame formation and composition.[6] The common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on convection, as soot tends to rise to the top of a flame (such as in a candle in normal gravity conditions), making it yellow. In microgravity or zero gravity environment, such as on a circular orbit , convection no longer occurs and the flame becomes spherical, with a tendency to become bluer and more efficient. There are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely is the hypothesis that the temperature is sufficiently evenly distributed that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs.[7] Experiments by NASA reveal that diffusion flames in microgravity allow more soot to be completely oxidized after they are produced than do diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behave differently in microgravity when compared to normal gravity conditions.[8][9] These discoveries have potential applications in applied science and industry, especially concerning fuel efficiency. A video of a microgravity flame in the NASA Glenn 5 s drop facility is at [2]."

THAT would be a much more realistic picture.  The CEOs are not raping their employees and customers because they necessarily find absurd, insane, and irrational expectations of profit growth are possible.  They're mostly doing it because their company is public and Goldman Sachs owns enough shares to nearly bankrupt them (and destroy the value of all the executives, destroy their shareholders, etc) if they don't pursue absolutely unwise measures to gain temporary bursts of profit, while committing suicide in the long run (Goldman Sachs will move on when the company falls dead, leaving hundreds of thousands of damaged employees and customers in the wake, all blaming the company and the CEO)."

2) Tarrifs
3) Minimum wages
4) Union protection
5) TaxesIt is a persons right to demand a certain salary.  Whether or not they are given that is based on somebodies willingness to pay that salary, and everybody had the RIGHT to pay and demand WHATEVER THEY WISH.When Unions, Consumers, Executives, Monopolists, Entrepreneurs, or Financiers stand in line at the Government piggy bank wanting handouts they are hurting the economy, and in the long run, themselves.The reason all of this was able to happen is because of GOVERNMENT.  The FINANCIAL world wouldn't be as risky if they didn't know first hand that GOVERNMENT was going to ""bail them out"" like they have repeatedly done from the collapse of the PESO and SOUTH EAST ASIA.government is SUBSIDIZING the risks the FINANCIAL WORLD took at the expenses of ALL TAXPAYERS, corporations and individuals alike.Watch PBS's the crash."

You can pay me back with interest... say... 35 cents. The lemonade will surely be worth 50 cents tomorrow...  You can even drink part of it, sell the rest, and still be able to pay me back.Susie: Well, I guess... you've been selling lemonade for so long, you should know.Calvin: Here ya go.Random kids: Wow, what an easy way to make dough! We'll take some of your lemonade too on exactly those terms.Random kid: Hey, if I can get another kid to loan me money against the future value of this lemonade, I can invest it in lemons now and be a millionaire by the end of the day.

I sure am glad lemonade's a fungible commodity.Moe 2: Sure, I'll be making some dough when Susie won't be able to pay you back, so I feel comfortable loaning you more money now.Mom: Geez, look at all that lemonade Calvin is selling... and if Moe 2 is still lending him money, he must be doing something right. IfIwant to sell any lemonade I better do like he does so I don't lose any market share.(next day)Susie: Gee, I drank only a sip of that lemonade, and now no one wants to buy it.

Here's some lemonade.Moe 2: Don't have it? day-old lemonade? yuck.Moe 2 (to Moe 1): see he doesn't have it, pay up.Moe 1: I don't have any money, I was betting with those other kids that they'd be able to sell their lemonade, that was the only way I'd be able to pay you.Moe 2: no money?Moe 1: no money.Calvin: Well I'd have some if you let me borrow some more.Moe 2, Moe 1 and Calvin fall into a dust storm of fighting... Calvin narrowly escapes the frayMom: Geez things are hairy out there. I sure loaned out a lot of lemonade. I don't think I'm ever getting paid back. Now they'll all come whining to me about how they lost all their moneyandtheir lemonade.Maybe Calvin's system isn't working out so hot, but If he has to shut down his lemonade stand, nobody will have lemonade ever.Mom (to Calvin): Here, Calvin. This is 2 dollars. Buy some lemons and sugar.Susie: I lost all my lemonade too, and my quarter, now I can't buy anything.Mom (to Susie): Here Susie, this is 2 dollars, you should be able to plant a lemon tree with this, and you'll have all the lemonade you want. You can help me with chores if you want more.(Mom continues paying out to all the neighborhood kids and the bullies for the blunder she and Calvin made.)Mom: What the hell am I gonna do with all this day-old lemonade?(later)Dad: Where'd all our friggin money go? and What's with all this day-old lemonade. And why are you in the lemonade business to begin with?Mom: What matters is that all the neighborhood kids have been made whole.Dad: What do you mean... made whole‽ They took lemonade for free and then treated it as if it was worth a fortune to create an intricate web of bets and loans that ran the neighborhood economy into the ground.. and your answer is to dole out cash?Mom: Well, we have to keep them occupied somehow or else they'll be in their houses bugging their parents and breaking things.Dad: Well I guess you're right. We can't just donothing(elsewhere)Calvin: MONEY MONEY MONEY MONEY!Hobbes: Maybe you should try to just.. you know.. sell lemonade.Calvin: But how am I supposed to make money doing that?

If the lending wasn't easy, the houses wouldn't have increased in price.After the mortgage finalized, it was sold off as mutual funds.The cause? People defaulted when interest rates increased on arm loans as sky high interest rates. This is why the government stepped in and helped people refinance, because most people canNOTpay predatory interest rates.The banks wouldn't let people refinance, so they compounded the issue. (They couldn't  refinance due to them being locked up in mutual funds...)And the whole argument of it was the public's fault, they are overlooking that the public was told (By Everyone) you can refinance later, take the arm now.Its the financial responsibility of the banks not the public. The bank is lending the investors money, they fail its their fault.  They where not regulated, they could do what ever they wanted.  They broke investment rules, lending rules, and the sniff of money lead everyone to turn their heads.So we basically, let the banks rip everyone off, then the government came in, payed them more money...And the Banks said they wouldn't load money if they didn't get money.  And this is the lie thats being fed to us. Even Obama in his presidential speech on Monday reported the Banks lied on the first part of the Tarp loans.Bah, this post is just making me mad, the banks are getting hand outs left and right that Throwing money at the problem is the only solution. That ""Doing Nothing"" is the only aternative.  When its not. The feds should have taken over every bank in a Bankruptcy and ran it.All these lies repeated by people dont make them the truth.."

It's like gossiping behind someone's back, except nobody will ever even know it was you.The other thing I've come to realize is that most conversation don't have much real content.  Truly engaging discussions are noteworthy even in person, so it's not really reasonable to expect them consistently online.Trolling for kicks will just leave you bitter, though I guess you'll have a few laughs."

Thus I, Abraham, talked with the Lord, face to face, as one man talketh with another; and he told me of the works which his hands had made; 
And he said unto me: My son, my son (and his hand was stretched out), behold I will show you all these [stars]. And he put his hand upon mine eyes, and I saw those things which his hands had made, which were many; and they [stars] multiplied before mine eyes, and I could not see the end thereof.Moses 1:29,33,35,37-39 (LDS in the US believe in extra-terestrial life)
29 And he [Moses] beheld many lands; and each land was called earth, and there were inhabitants on the face thereof.
33 And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten.
35 But only an account of this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, give I unto you. For behold, there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power. And there are many that now stand, and innumerable are they unto man; but all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and I know them.
37 And the Lord God spake unto Moses, saying: The heavens, they are many, and they cannot be numbered unto man; but they are numbered unto me, for they are mine. 
38 And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another come; and there is no end to my works, neither to my words.

If so, why?""Adams transgression did not doom alpha-centaurians (aliens), because (of three things) alpha-centaurians are not literal descendants of Adam, they were not put under Adam's dominion (Genesis 1:26,28; 2:19), nor did they exist in the same time frame (before the time of repentence Alma 42:4-10 wherein Adam was not subject to death) as Adam at the time of the transgression.  The penality for sin (death) extends by lineage (Exodus 20:5:34:7; Numbers 14:18; Deut. 5:9; D&C 103:26).Genesis 2:19
19 And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.Gen. 1:26
26 ...and let them (mankind) have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.Alma 42:4

Let it settle. Let it sink in a bit, the infinity, the endlessness of space. If space is infinite, then it follows that every point in space is the center of the universe. Time is the only ""phenomenon"" that can mark out the perceived distance between ""seperate"" ""things"". And the mind is the place where space and time and things are ""witnessed"" by... somebody. The mind is the place where the experience of infinity ""takes place"". The mind, quite possibly, is infinity itself.On closer inspection, time is to space, as memory is to mind. The one records the infinity of the other. Distance in the universe is measured by time, but if distance is infinite (because there will always be more space to measure) then measurement is merely arbitrary and a function for someone's use (to get from A to B). In the same way, memory records the infinite experiences of the mind (by using time itself to narrow down infinity into a series of comprehensible ""moments"") A side effect of this is the creation of a ""self"". He who is the ""owner"" of the mind, the dweller in space. Memory of the many yesterdays reinforces the solidness of the self's position as the one who is ""being here"".The self blocks infinity (quite accidently) by failing to notice the memory store is moment by moment ""judging, allowing, measuring"" that which is infinitely appearing before it (experience). The stain of the many yesterdays destroys possibility by categorizing the ""infinitely new"", the present itself (all that there is), into a mere moment on a long chain supposedly stretching from the far past(my first memory) to some future terminus point (my death?). Either way, infinity is locked down, unseen, and the self suffers for being seperated from all that is (the universe)."

Why couldn't there be a universe that's ""round"" but on the inside? If you ""sail"" too far, you end up back in India or England, whichever, where you started from in the first place. Scientists (especially of the ""holographic"" variety are already saying that certain portions of the universe resemble themselves).Don't laugh. I'm not looking for upvotes, really. This fractal universe makes me think I'm being quite serious."

First, like your balloon, the universe might have what we call positive curvature, like a sphere. In this case, which we call a ""closed"" universe, the universe would be finite in size but without a boundary, just like the balloon. In a closed universe, you could, in principle, fly a spaceship far enough in one direction and get back to where you started from. Closed universes are also closed in time: they eventually stop expanding, then contract in a ""Big Crunch."" All the geometry that is true on a sphere is also true in a closed unvierse: parallel lines eventually converge (e.g. longitude lines are parallel at the equator, but converge at the poles), large triangles have more than 180 degrees, etc.The second possibility is that the universe is flat. This kind of universe you can imagine by cutting out a piece of your baloon material and stretching it with your hands. The surface of the material is flat, not curved, but you can expand and contract it by tugging on either end. Flat universes are infinite in spatial extent, and have no boundaries. Parallel lines are always parallel and triangles always have 180 degrees. Flat universes expand forever, but the expansion rate approaches zero.Finally, the universe might be ""open,"" or have negative curvature. Such universes are sort of saddle-shaped. They are also infinite and unbounded. Parellel lines eventually diverge, and triangles have less than 180 degrees. Open universes expand forever, with the expansion rate never approaching zero.http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=62"

And revolving at nine hundred miles an hour,
That's orbiting at nineteen miles a second, so it's reckoned,
A sun that is the source of all our power.
The sun and you and me and all the stars that we can see
Are moving at a million miles a day
In an outer spiral arm, at forty thousand miles an hour,
Of the galaxy we call the 'Milky Way'.Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars.
It's a hundred thousand light years side to side.
It bulges in the middle, sixteen thousand light years thick,
But out by us, it's just three thousand light years wide.
We're thirty thousand light years from galactic central point.
We go 'round every two hundred million years,
And our galaxy is only one of millions of billions
In this amazing and expanding universe.The universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
In all of the directions it can whizz
As fast as it can go, at the speed of light, you know,
Twelve million miles a minute, and that's the fastest speed there is.
So remember, when you're feeling very small and insecure,
How amazingly unlikely is your birth,
And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space,
'Cause there's bugger all down here on Earth."

A star that large is physically impossible as it will almost immediately collapse on itself.Upon further research, the largest star (VY Canis Majoris) is estimated to be 2,100 times the diameter of our Sun making it 2,923,200,000 km across taking light roughly 2.7 hrs to travel from one end to the other.This is still huge considering it takes about 8 minutes for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth."

It takes the form ""A implies B, B is true, therefore A is true.""  Paraphrasing and completing the unwritten in your reply, ""An incompletely known universe harbors the potential for the existence of a god, the universe cannot be fully known, therefore god exists.""  I usually see this as an argument for agnosticism instead of gnostic deism.In reality, the fact that we exist in a universe perfectly created for us is explained rationally by something called theweak anthropic principle.  It states in layman's terms that the universe is of course perfect for life — if it weren't, we wouldn't have evolved in it.In my opinion, the Judeo-Christian god, with his unitary focus on the societal conflicts of preindustrial savages seems small compared to the complexity of the universe.

There is no reason to believe in God.  Why would the complexity of the universe make it more likely for God to exist?  It doesn't.By your brand of reasoning, I could say that everything in the bottom of the sea was created by some divine entity, simply because there's a whole world of things we don't understand down there.There is simply no logical step between ""This thing is complex"" and ""So it was created by a sentient being""."

Both use the magnificence and awe-inspiring qualities of nature and the Universe to support their argument. Personally, I don't really think it makes a difference, as a scientist I just want to understand what surrounds me. Whether there is or not a power behind the grandeur of the Cosmos is beyond my line of work.Yet, there would be no way for me to be satisfied with the belief that a deity is behind every single phenomena and occurrence in one's life. In my experience such could not be an explanation capable of satisfying any mind that is truly curious. If anything, it only promotes conformity and kills the inherent desire to know more and more importantly, to question logically that which is thought to be set in stone."

The Apartheid police state did two things for the country: made it a pariah among the rest of Africa while creating the continent's largest economy. With Apartheid gone and one of the world's most liberal constitutions in place, South Africa has become a magnet for refugees and the dispossessed from the rest of the continent. That influx, along with the dislocation of state institutions due to the end of apartheid, has created a situation any government would find difficult to handle.Even so, the government has some built-in problems which exacerbate the whole situation. The controlling party, the ANC (African National Congress), was an armed organization built to resist apartheid. The transition to peaceful governance went well under its last competent leader, Mandela, but has become increasingly rocky with the weak Mbeki and now the violent Zuma governments. All opposition parties are mere splinters, so for the time being whomever controls the ANC runs the show, and in the finest of African traditions it seems self-enrichment has a higher priority than good governance.This is the trajectory South Africa will have until the ANC fractures. Labor in South Africa is beginning to pull away from the wealthy, but I doubt that this generation can break with their partners from the resistance days. Many people feel that South Africa could easily go down the road that Zimbabwe has taken and Kenya is now traveling on, as the same forces are at work. Young white South Africans have scattered themselves all over the continent and the world, as they feel they can't control or stop what's afoot in their home country.The end of colonial rule in almost all African countries seems to result in at least half a century of unrest and violence; I rather doubt South Africa can avoid this. It's such a shame, as it's a beautiful country filled with wonderful people.One final note: I left Africa feeling that this is the only place a species like man could have evolved on Earth. The continent, the largest one on Earth that straddles the equator, is incredibly competitive and violent, with predators revered. With such energy and no quarter given or taken, it was the perfect cradle for a top competitor such as man."

All of the victims white of course.  Try to imagine this.  A grandmother and her granddaughter are brutally raped next to each other, tortured, and killed while the girls parents are at work.

Just for the sake of comparison, how many white dudes on the walk to the bus stop are you scared of?I won't lie, I have the same feelings sometimes, but at least be honest about them: it's racist, or at the very least, prejudiced, to be scared of most large black males you pass on the street.It's an artifact of growing up in a society in which we are told from a very young age through tv shows, movies, and the news, that large black men are to be feared and avoided.  Or at least that's how I feel, since I'm not a practicing media scholar or sociologist.Not that I'm railing against the media, but I don't think one can combat one's inner racist without recognizing it first.So yes, complaining about all the scary black dudes in Oakland or whatever densely populated, urban area we're referring to is racist.

But several races, in combination with a few other visual cues, can be quite scary.  Therefore, I've edited out ""large black males"" in the text i quoted, so that I may offend people more equally.(2)  Once, Jesse Jackson was walking alone late at night in DC.  He heard footsteps behind him and was worried he was about to be mugged.  He turned and saw it was a white man, and relaxed.  He talks of the embarassment/shame he feels about his reaction.  Is Jesse Jackson racist against black people?  NO.  Is he generally scared of black people?  NO.  He simply knows that:(alone + night + DC + black footsteps) = high statistical chance of being mugged.I stand by my main point:  Political correctness can kill you."

It gets people preoccupied with what they can and can't say (and/or think), rather than the topic that needs to be discussed.Even this picture.  You could have a really interesting discussion about why it is or isn't funny, whether it's really a juxtaposition, what social factors are involved, etc.  Instead, it's good for a smirk on the internet when you know your boss isn't looking over your shoulder -- whether you're amused because it's racist, ironic, or for other reasons.Sometimes, a person has to be able to say whatever racist shit is floating in the recesses of their mind in order to think rationally about what's going on in their subconscious.  Preventing dialogue prevents people from verbally processing some of the thoughts floating around in their minds -- sometimes, thoughts you want to discard.A lot of people are auditory thinkers.  For example, when proofreading a paper, sometimes it helps to read aloud because you catch mistakes that you don'tseewhen reading internally.  The same mechanism can apply to our personal biases and baggage -- sometimes you don't know what you've got until you air it out a bit."

Years after her husband died, they were both engineers, she was living with her boyfriend and her 14 y.o. son.  A group of male refugees from Zimbabwe came south and were raising hell in a group of mostly white farms and homes.  The police couldn't care less.  They came to her house one night over a month after the first attacks by them had gone uninvestigated by the police.  They murdered her boyfriend for trying to stop them from raping her, and beat her son into a pulp, he spent over a month in the hospital.  Overall they killed about a dozen white South Africans, and the police didn't care.  We had to go there and literally ride shotgun up to her house to get her stuff and pack it up, as my fathers boss gave her a job in his Australian division and was paying for everything.  Couple weeks later a group of those farmers, some of them black along with their white friends, hunted down the murderers and rapists and took them out.Whats sad is that a couple months before a group of ""refugees"" attacked a black settlement, cops responded immediately and apprehended them within 3 days.Racism is still alive and well in South Africa."

The L-series 24-70mm is a lot longer and has a deeper lens hood. 16-35 f/2.8L EF and 70-200 f/2.8L EF on separate camera bodies are pretty much standard equipment for non-sports press photographers who shoot Canon (Nikon lenses vary slightly). Both are self-contained (unlike the 24-70, which extends over its focal length) and exhibit extraordinarily high build and optical quality. Like a Mercedes taxi cab, they're well worth the high cost, considering the way they maintain quality in the face of excessive use.The lens on the right is an 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 EF-S (EF-S lenses vary from EF lenses by having a shorter distance between the back of the lens and sensor surface), it's probably the non-stabilized Mark II version judging by the single switch next to the alignment marker on the left. It is packaged as the standard lens with Canon's consumer SLRs and it is just an awful, awful lens. Notice that the photographer has their flash popped open (the camera is a Rebel XT or XTi, the original Digital Rebel didn't come in black as far as I know), which suggests they are or were shooting on automatic settings and probably don't have a lot of photo training."

Although it depends on who you're asking, the second statement is neither true nor false. Perhaps you want to object and note that 'this' refers to 'Today is not opposite day'. In that case, the opposite of your first statement would then create a truth value for the second statement which is contrary to the original purpose of saying that second statement at all. You don't escape the contradictory loop, my friend, no matter how clever you think you are.The only marginal solution to 'the problem of declaring opposite day' I've arrived at is to say exactly what you have said in your first statement, but only by itself. ""It is not opposite day!"" and you leave the rest to pragmatics and implication, i.e., there is really no good reason to declare today as not-opposite day other than to draw attention to a) the fact that you are saying and b) the topic of your declaration. This could effectively hint at the fact that things are awry (all things are now opposite!).Anyway, opposite day doesn't fucking work no matter how you look at it, because the scope of what we think should be opposite is typically much smaller than that of a true opposite day. And many semantic constructions are not dichotomous or antithetical anyway.Hello."

And this belief is positive as it makes the loser very grateful and the finder feel good at being thanked.I once received my phone back from a couple of teens from the roughest part of town.  They called my dad to let him know they found my phone.  When I got it back, I thought they'd have used up all my minutes, subscribed me to porn SMSs and wiped their shit over the battery and SIM or something.  Basically I prejudged the teens for being teens from a crap part of town.  Of course they'd done nothing bad at all and I learnt a valuable lesson."

So if I see a kid on its own my first response is to start walking the other way, I'm not joking!As for the car, not in a lifetime! Someone who forgot to turn their headlights off probably forgot to set their brake too, or their alarm will go off, or there's some obscure city ordinance that says ""anyone caught trying a car door can be charged as a car thief"" fuck that!If I'm with people then I'll help, if not, I'll call the police or tell someone, but why the fuck should I risk my ass when society punishes anyone who takes initiative."

But one day, he was walking along a dense part of the jungle and he stepped on a big sharp thorn. The thorn went into his paw and he was paralised with pain! He lay there all morning roaring in pain and licking his thorned paw, unable to pull it out. But his luck soon changed: just then, a little door mouse came scurrying through the jungle. The mouse saw the lion and realised he couldn't move because of the thorn in his paw. He thought to himself ""Wouldn't it be good if I helped the lion?"" so he walked up and pulled the thorn out with his teeth! The lion jumped in the air with surprise, and suddenly, realising the thorn was free from his paw, he decided he was hungry and ate the mouse."

I got in my car and followed his car for a few miles and then went back and reported his license plate # to store security."

I understand the intention is wonderful, I do. But, what the people who do this, OBVIOUSLY don't ever seem to think about is that some people intentionally leave their doors unlocked. If the key mechanism in the door is broken (not uncommon), the owner will leave the door unlocked, SO THEY CAN GET IN.This exact thing that nice people do, someone did to my girlfriend a couple months ago. She ended up having to pay $80 for a locksmith to break into her car.please, turn people's lights off. even write them a stupid letter talking about how good a person you are. but do NOT ever mess with peoples' locks.uncalled for."

I wouldn't care if someone went in my vehicle and just sat there to get out of the rain or something as long as they don't break or steal anything. I'm sure I might be upset at first, but once Iknowtheir intentions I can't see caring, but I never lock my doors simply out of convenience.Most people seriously worry about it way too much imo. I live in a city with a decent amount of crime (richmond va) and I've not once had anything happen. I leave both my apartment and my truck unlocked. If it gets stolen it gets stolen, it's a risk I take, but it's a riskItake, don't come along and lock my fucking car. I guess I wouldn't care most the time, but along the same lines as you said I'll often just leave my keys, wallet, and/or phone in the car. If someone came and locked it there's a good chance I'm gonna be locked out."

I had to open it to find whose it was (they didnt put a return address on the outside of the envelope)... I looked up the name in the phone book & called her to let her know I found the letter & asked if she wanted me to return it to her or mail it. It was a utility bill.I've also returned a bunch of lost dogs to their owners over the years.... that I have run across at my work.  That's why you always want to have a tag on your dog that at LEAST has your phone number or address on it. Finding a dog with no tag makes me very sad.
